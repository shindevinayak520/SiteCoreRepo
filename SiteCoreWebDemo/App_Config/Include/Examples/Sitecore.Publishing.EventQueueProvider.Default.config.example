Purpose: This include file replaces the AsyncEventQueueProvider implementation with DefaultEventQueueProvider.
The only difference between the two implementations is that the AsyncEventQueueProvider processes queued events from various databases asynchronously and
DefaultEventQueueProvider process queued events sequentially.

To enable this include file, rename it to have a ".config" extension.
